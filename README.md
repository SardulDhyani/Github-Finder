# Github Finder
A simple JavaScript application which uses GitHub API to fetch GitHub users and their repositories

# Languages Used
HTML and JavaScript

I have used the Bootswatch custom theme you can use any other styling it depends upon you, you just have to replace imports from the index.html file.

Please create your API key and replace the dummy client id and key with your client id and API key.

This application was built during Learning JavaScript from "The modern JavaScript" course offered by Brad Traversy
